@article{Delgoda2013,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to real time automatic flood control in a managed river network that is subject to uncertain inflows. The proposed approach uses multiple models to represent inflows ranging from low to high flow. Optimal model selection is achieved in a minimum mean square error sense using a bank of Kalman filters to identify the most likely inflow characteristic. There are no a-priori probabilities assigned to the individual models. Model Predictive Control is used for water level controller design. Our Adaptive Multi Model Predictive Control (AMMPC) method is proposed as an alternative to existing techniques that also use multiple inflow models but with a-priori inflow model probabilities, either weighted or equally likely. The performance of the approach is demonstrated using a simulated river-reservoir model as well as using data collected at the Wivenhoe Dam during the 2011 floods in Queensland, Australia.},

@article{Verhoeven:2010aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Wetlands are species-rich habitats performing valuable ecosystem services such as flood protection, water quality enhancement, food chain support and carbon sequestration. Worldwide, wetlands have been drained to convert them into agricultural land or industrial and urban areas. A realistic estimate is that 50 {\%} of the world's wetlands have been lost. SCOPE: This paper reviews the relationship between wetlands and agriculture with the aim to identify the successes and failures of agricultural use in different types of wetlands, with reference to short-term and long-term benefits and issues of sustainability. It also addresses a number of recent developments which will lead to pressure to reclaim and destroy natural wetlands, i.e. the continuous need for higher production to feed an increasing world population and the increasing cultivation of energy crops. Finally, attention is paid to the development of more flood-tolerant crop cultivars. CONCLUSIONS: Agriculture has been carried out in several types of (former) wetlands for millennia, with crop fields on river floodplain soils and rice fields as major examples. However, intensive agricultural use of drained/reclaimed peatlands has been shown to lead to major problems because of the oxidation and subsidence of the peat soil. This does not only lead to severe carbon dioxide emissions, but also results in low-lying land which needs to be protected against flooding. Developments in South-East Asia, where vast areas of tropical peatlands are being converted into oil palm plantations, are of great concern in this respect. Although more flood-tolerant cultivars of commercial crop species are being developed, these are certainly not suitable for cultivation in wetlands with prolonged flooding periods, but rather will survive relatively short periods of waterlogging in normally improved agricultural soils. From a sustainability perspective, reclamation of peatlands for agriculture should be strongly discouraged. The opportunities for agriculture in naturally functioning floodplains should be further investigated. The development and use of crop cultivars with an even stronger flood tolerance could form part of the sustainable use of such floodplain systems. Extensive use of wetlands without drastic reclamation measures and without fertilizer and pesticides might result in combinations of food production with other wetland services, with biodiversity remaining more or less intact. There is a need for research by agronomists and environmental scientists to optimize such solutions.},
